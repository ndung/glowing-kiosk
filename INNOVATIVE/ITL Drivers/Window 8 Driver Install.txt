Windows 8 requires drivers to be signed by microsoft.  This will prevent installation of ITL 
drivers being installed.

If you have a windows 8 platform, the below instructions will disable this feature, and installation 
can continue.

Basically you have to boot in a non-standard mode.

The easy way to do this is to use the Shutdown command with the  /o  parameter:
So you open a admin level command prompt and type:

shutdown.exe /r /o /f /t 0

    /r         Full shutdown and restart the computer.
    /o         Go to the advanced boot options menu and restart the computer.
               Must be used with /r option.
    /f         Force running applications to close without forewarning users.
    /t xxx     Set the time-out period before shutdown to xxx seconds.

When the system restarts you can select "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement" from the option screens.
