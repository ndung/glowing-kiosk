    1.) 4 points calibration
    2.) 9 points calibration
    3.) 25 points calibration
    4.) Draw Test

Usage:
    TKCal [Port] [CalType] 

    [Port]: Port device name where the controller is connected.
    [CalType]: Function options.
        It can be Cal   -> To do 4 points calibration.
                  Linz9 -> To do 9 points calibration.
                  Linz  -> To do 25 points calibration.
                  Draw  -> To execute DrawTest for function testing.

Example:
    TKCal /dev/ttyS0 Cal

    for 4 points calibration for the TouchKit controller on COM1.

    Software developer can use function call "system" to integrate with
    its application program as follows.
