Known issue:

    Some old distributions with kernel 2.4.x does not have libXrandr.so.2
    shared library for TouchKit utility, e.g. Red Hat Linux 8.
    The error messages below might be shown on the screen after running
    TouchKit utility.

    Error:
        ./TouchKit: error while loading shared libraries: libXrandr.so.2:
        cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

    The user can refer to the following suggestions to solve the problem.
    1.) Upgrade the new system. e.g. Red Hat Linux 9.
    2.) Use the TKCal tool which is compressed in TKCal directory to do
        calibration instead of TouchKit utility.
