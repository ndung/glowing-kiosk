# =============================== File List =============================== #

(*) Installation with script file:
    User can run the "setup.sh" script to install the driver archive
    easily in a terminal window.

    Syntax:
        sh setup.sh            # To install the eGalax Touch driver.
    or  sh setup.sh uninstall  # To remove the eGalax Touch driver.
    or  sh setup.sh version    # To get the installer version.

    Note that the root permission is required to run this installation
    script. Otherwise, below error messages would be popped up.
    ( Assume, the working distribution is Ubuntu 8.04 )

    test@test-desktop:~$ sh setup.sh
    (*) Linux driver installer for eGalax Touch controller

    (I) Check user permission: test, you are NOT the supervisor.
    (E) The root permission is required to run this installer.

    The user can get the root permission by the following command.
    For example:
                su        ( For general Linux )
            or  sudo -s   ( For Ubuntu series only )

(*) Driver archive installation:

    root@test-desktop:~# sh setup.sh
    (*) Linux driver installer for eGalax Touch controller

    (I) Check user permission: root, you are the supervisor.
    (I) Begin to setup eGalax Touch driver.
    (I) Extract eGalax Touch driver archive to /usr/local/eGalaxTouch32.
    (I) Create eGalaxTouch utility shortcut in /usr/bin.
    (I) Create TKCal tool shortcut in /usr/bin.
    (I) Searching the X input modules directory.
    (I) Check X window version: 1.4.x
    (I) Copy X module: x14/egalax_drv.so to /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input.

    (Q) Which interface of controller do you use?
    (I) [1] RS232 [2] PS/2 [3] USB: 1
    (Q) Which COM port will be connected? e.g. /dev/ttyS0 (COM1)
    (A) Please input: /dev/ttyS0

    (I) Found X configuration file: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.
    (I) Add touch configuration into /etc/X11/xorg.conf.

    (I) Please reboot the system for some changes to take effect.
    (I) After booting, type "eGalaxTouch" to do calibration.

  1. For serial RS232 interface:
    (Q) Which interface controller do you use?
    (I) [1] RS232 [2] PS/2 [3] USB: 1
    (Q) Which COM port will be connected? e.g. /dev/ttyS0 (COM1)
    (A) Please input: /dev/ttyS4

    Note that the user has to input correct serial device node
    where the controller connected.
    For example:
            /dev/ttyS4    ( Connected to COM5 )

  2. For PS/2 interface:
    (Q) Which interface controller do you use?
    (I) [1] RS232 [2] PS/2 [3] USB: 2
    (I) Using interface: PS/2
    (I) Please make sure the kernel module for PS/2 controller is available.
    (I) For details, see the document "How to rebuild kernel.pdf".

  3. For USB interface:
    (Q) Which interface controller do you use?
    (I) [1] RS232 [2] PS/2 [3] USB: 3
    (I) Using interface: USB
    (I) Found a HID compliant touch controller.
    (I) Found inbuilt kernel module: usbtouchscreen.
    (I) It is highly recommended that add it into blacklist.
    (Q) Do you want to add it into blacklist? (y/n) y
    (I) Add kernel module usbtouchscreen into /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.

    Note that it is highly recommended that add inbuilt kernel module
    "usbtouchscreen" or "touchkitusb" into blacklist to avoid conflict
    if the touch controller is HID compliant device.

    (Q) Which interface controller do you use?
    (I) [1] RS232 [2] PS/2 [3] USB: 3
    (I) Using interface: USB
    (I) Found a non-HID compliant touch controller.
    (W) No inbuilt kernel module for touch controller found.
    (I) It is needed to build "tkusb" kernel module for touch controller.
    (I) For details, see the document "How to build module.pdf".

    Note that the user needs to build the eGalax Touch kernel module "tkusb"
    for touch controller if the inbuilt kernel module "usbtouchscreen" or
    "touchkitusb" does NOT exist in the kernel.

(*) Driver archive un-installation

    root@test-desktop:~# sh setup.sh uninstall
    (*) Linux driver installer for eGalax Touch controller

    (I) Check user permission: root, you are the supervisor.
